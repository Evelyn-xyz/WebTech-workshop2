        Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,<br/>
        And sorry I could not travel both<br/>
        And be one traveler, long I stood<br/>
        And looked down one as far as I could<br/>
        To where it bent in the undergrowth;<br/>
        </p><p>
        Then took the other, as just as fair,<br/>
        And having perhaps the better claim,<br/>
        Because it was grassy and wanted wear;<br/>
        Though as for that the passing there<br/>
        Had worn them really about the same,
        </p><p>
        And both that morning equally lay<br/>
        In leaves no step had trodden black.<br/>
        Oh, I kept the first for another day!<br/>
        Yet knowing how way leads on to way,<br/>
        I doubted if I should ever come back.
        </p><p>
        I shall be telling this with a sigh<br/>
        Somewhere ages and ages hence:<br/>
        Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—<br/>
        I took the one less traveled by,<br/>
        And that has made all the difference.

            Robert Frost wrote “The Road Not Taken” as a joke for a friend, the poet Edward Thomas. When they went walking together, Thomas was chronically indecisive about which road they ought to take and—in retrospect—often lamented that they should, in fact, have taken the other one. Soon after writing the poem in 1915, Frost griped to Thomas that he had read the poem to an audience of college students and that it had been “taken pretty seriously … despite doing my best to make it obvious by my manner that I was fooling. … Mea culpa.” However, Frost liked to quip, “I’m never more serious than when joking.” As his joke unfolds, Frost creates a multiplicity of meanings, never quite allowing one to supplant the other—even as “The Road Not Taken” describes how choice is inevitable. 
            </p><p>
            “The Road Not Taken” begins with a dilemma, as many fairytales do. Out walking, the speaker comes to a fork in the road and has to decide which path to follow. (Source: <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/articles/89511/robert-frost-the-road-not-taken" target="_blank" class="link">Poetry Foundation</a>).
            </p>
            
            <p>The poem masquerades as a meditation about choice, but the critic William Pritchard suggests that the speaker is admitting that “choosing one rather than the other was a matter of impulse, impossible to speak about any more clearly than to say that the road taken had ‘perhaps the better claim.’” In many ways, the poem becomes about how—through retroactive narrative—the poet turns something as irrational as an “impulse” into a triumphant, intentional decision. Decisions are nobler than whims, and this reframing is comforting, too, for the way it suggests that a life unfolds through conscious design. However, as the poem reveals, that design arises out of constructed narratives, not dramatic actions.</p><p>

            Having made his choice, the speaker declares, “Oh, I kept the first for another day!” The diction up until now has been matter-of-fact, focusing on straightforward descriptions and avoiding figurative language. This line initiates a change: as the speaker shifts from depiction to contemplation, the language becomes more stilted, dramatic, and old-fashioned. This tonal shift subtly illustrates the idea that the concept of choice is, itself, a kind of artifice. </p><p>

            Thus far, the entire poem has been one sentence. The meandering syntax of this long sentence—which sprawls across stanzas, doubling back on itself, revising its meaning, and delaying the finality of decisiveness—mirrors the speaker’s thought process as he deliberates. The neatness of how the sentence structure suddenly converges with the line structure (this sentence is exactly one line) echoes the sudden, clean division that choice creates. </p>
